# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

# Overview Of K-Means Clustering
* The __K-Means__ model works by finding different groups (clusters) of data points that share similar properties within the dataset. It does that by grouping the points in such a way that minimizes the distance of all the points to the centroid of the cluster in which they are contained.

* In other words: the main objective of the algorithm is to find clusters so that the distance between data points in the same cluster is smaller than the distance between any two points in different clusters. This way, members that fall on the same group tend to share similar characteristics and be different from members of other groups.

# Dataset Description
* We start by using the __Recency__, __Frequency__, __MonetaryValue__, and __Tenure__.
* With this, we can expect to group together like-minded customers and the analyze these different groups for insights and trend to help formulate future business decisions.

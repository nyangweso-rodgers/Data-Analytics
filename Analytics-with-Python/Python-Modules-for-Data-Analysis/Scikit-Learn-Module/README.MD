# Introducing Scikit - Learn
* __Scikit-Learn__, a package that provides efficient versions of a large number of common algorithms. __Scikit-Learn__ is characterized by a _clean_, _uniform_, and _streamlined API_, as well as by very useful and complete online documentation.


# Basics of the Scikit Learn API
* Most commonly, the steps in using the __Scikit-Learn estimator API__ are as follows:
    1. Choose a class of model by importing the appropriate estimator class from __Scikit-Learn__.
    2. Choose model __hyperparameters__ by instantiating this class with desired values.
    3. Arrange data into a _features matrix_ and _target vector_.
    4. __Fit__ the model to your data by calling the__ fit()__ method of the model instance.
    5. Apply the model to new data:

• For __supervised learning__, often we _predict labels_ for unknown data using the ___predict()__ method.

• For __unsupervised learning__, we often transform or infer properties of the data using the __transform()__ or __predict()__ method.
